<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Trump vs Alien</h1>
 
<strong>Interaction</strong>: The interaction that I will be using for this project is "MAKEY MAKEY". I got my idea from hearing everyone whining about having Donald Trump as the American President. So I wanted to involve him as much as I could so I made a game with him and aliens fighting each other.

<strong>Description</strong>: My game, involves 2 players which one player is Donald Trump and the other player is a Spaceship. Both can shoot missils. Donald Trump shoots money and the spaceship shoots lasers. In my final project, you will have 3 lives for each player and the first player with 0 life will explode. And then it will bring everyone back to the home screen.
